## üé® Design System

### Color System

The color palette was chosen to convey a modern, clean, and approachable aesthetic:

- **Primary Color:** `#AC87C5` ‚Äì A soft lavender used for headings and accents, creating a calm and elegant mood.
- **Secondary Color:** `#E0AED0` ‚Äì Used for background highlights and sections to add depth without overwhelming the content.
- **Accent Color:** `#756AB6` ‚Äì Used sparingly for emphasis and interactive elements like buttons or hover states.
- **Neutral Backgrounds:** White (`#FFFFFF`) and light gray (`#F8F8F8`) ensure high readability and minimal distraction from core content.
- **Text Color:** Deep gray (`#333333`) for excellent contrast and legibility.

**Rationale:** The palette combines calm tones with contrast to maintain readability and focus while giving the site a creative yet professional appearance.

### Breakpoint Logic

The application is fully responsive with the following breakpoint strategy:

- **Mobile (Default)** ‚Äì Single-column layout with stacked sections, optimized for small screens.
- **Tablet (‚â• 768px)** ‚Äì Medium (MD) breakpoint switches to a **two-column grid layout** for content sections, improving usability and visual hierarchy.
- **Desktop (‚â• 1024px)** ‚Äì Full-width layouts with flexbox/grid enhancements for optimal presentation of images, text, and navigation.

## üñåÔ∏è Creative Divergence from the Mockup

While maintaining the core structure and purpose of the original design mockup, several intentional creative choices were made:

- **Color Overhaul:** A custom color palette (see above) was implemented to enhance visual identity and emotional tone, diverging from the mockup's original colors.
- **Typography Enhancements:** Font weights and sizes were adjusted for improved hierarchy and readability, especially on smaller screens.
- **Interactive Animations:** Smooth hover transitions and minor animations were added for a more dynamic user experience.
- **Content Spacing:** Improved padding and margins were introduced to avoid content crowding and enhance overall layout flow.
- **Visual Hierarchy:** Additional heading levels and emphasized elements help guide the user through the content in a more intentional manner.

## üìÅ Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories and files:

- `index.html` ‚Äì The main HTML file that structures the web page.
- `css/` ‚Äì Contains all CSS stylesheets for styling the application.
- `js/` ‚Äì Includes JavaScript files that add interactivity and dynamic behavior.
- `assets/` ‚Äì Stores image assets used throughout the application.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **HTML5** ‚Äì For structuring the web content.
- **CSS3** ‚Äì For styling and layout.
- **JavaScript** ‚Äì For interactive features and dynamic content.
